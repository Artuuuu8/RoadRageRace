# RoadRageRace
This is a multiplayer game that will run locally on two instances. One player will control his car with AWSD and the other will control it with the arrow keys. The game constists of 2 different players and their car racing down a straight track. If the palyers touch the player who is hit will slow down and the other will maintain its speed. For the palyer with the controls AWSD, A and D will guide the direction of the car, W will be the gas and S will be the brake. For the arrows, the smae concept accplies, with the right and left arrows being the direction, the top being the gas and the bottom being the brake. There will be a guardarail to both sides of the track, and hitting said guardrail will penalize the speed of the player. Ideally the car will be able to also spin out if it is being pit manouvered but this will be added if everything else works. The first player to reach the finish line will win.
